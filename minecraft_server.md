# Minecraft Server Privacy Policy

Last updated August 28th 2023.

**This policy is only for the Minecraft game server**. Any other services associated with the ORE community such as the main website at https://openredstone.org/ and the forum at https://discourse.openredstone.org/ have their own privacy policies. If you use those services, you should read their respective privacy policies.

ORE is an informal volunteer-run community focused on the video game Minecraft.

The "**server**", "**game server**", "**minecraft server**", or sometimes "**ORE**" is a Minecraft server which can be connected to with Minecraft using the address `mc.openredstone.org`, associated with the ORE community.

This privacy policy will explain how ORE uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our server.

By connecting to the ORE Minecraft server, you are consenting to this policy and the collection and processing of your data in the manner provided in this policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the server.

## What data do we collect?

ORE collects the following data:

- IP addresses
- Minecraft usernames and UUIDs
- The contents of chat messages and commands
- Other data produced as a result of actions in the game, including, but not limited to:
  - in-game creations
  - text written on signs or in books
  - custom names, lore, or other attributes applied to items in your player inventory.
  
  (Hereafter "**Other Game Data**")

## How do we collect your data?

You directly provide ORE with all of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you connect to our server and when you perform any actions in the game.

## How will we use your data?

ORE collects your data so that we can provide our services, primarily in the form of allowing you to interact with the game and with other users through the game server.

We also use data such as your Minecraft username and UUID and your IP address to keep track of misbehavior and to enforce bans.

Additionally, some data may be collected for analysis purposes, and we may perform analysis on our other collected data in order to provide insights in to how our server is used so that we can make improvements and inform administrative decisions.

We may also analyze data to generate statistics- of individuals or the general userbase- to share with the community for entertainment purposes. For example, we might create a leaderboard for who has jumped the most times, spent the longest amount of time on the server, or been AFK the longest; or we might release a list of the top 100 words said in chat, or the most common blocks used in builds.

Finally, game logs and world files which include your data may be retained indefinitely for historical and archival purposes. (World file archives are publicly accessible on our website at https://archive.openredstone.org.)

Some in-game actions may result in some of your data, including, but not limited to, your Minecraft username and UUID, the contents of your chat messages, and Other Game Data, being shared with third party services, namely:

### [Discord](https://discord.com)

- We maintain a status indicator in a Discord chat which lists the Minecraft usernames of all players currently connected to the server.
- We mirror the contents of in-game chat messages to a Discord chat in order to allow in-game users to chat with people on the Discord platform.
- We deliver notifications about some in-game actions to our staff team via a Discord chat for server moderation and administration purposes. These notifications may include any of the data we collect, and is intended to be accessible only to the staff team.

Any data which we share with Discord is subject to Discord's [privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

## How do we store your data?

ORE stores your data on a server located in Hillsboro, Oregon, provided by OVH US LLC.

ORE makes a sincere effort to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. We try our best to employ reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, no software or storage system is 100% secure, and as such we cannot provide an absolute guarantee of the safety of your information or data.

ORE stores data indefinitely. We do not currently have a strict data retention policy.

## What are your data protection rights?

ORE would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights.
Every user is entitled to the following:

**The right to access** – You have the right to request ORE for copies of your personal data. *We may charge you a small fee for this service.*

**The right to rectification** – You have the right to request that ORE correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request ORE to complete the information you believe is incomplete.

**The right to erasure** – You have the right to request that ORE erase your personal data, under certain conditions.

**The right to restrict processing** – You have the right to request that ORE restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.

## Privacy policies of other services

When playing on the ORE Minecraft server you may be directed to another service via a clickable link or some other means. This privacy policy applies only to our Minecraft server, so if you follow a link to a website or some other service, you should read their privacy policy.

## Children

In order to comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we do not knowingly collect personal information for any child under the age of 13. If you are a child under the age of 13, please avoid sharing any personal information via the chat, books, signs, or any other method. If you are the parent of a child under the age of 13 and have a concern regarding your child's information on ORE, please [contact us](#how-to-contact-us).

## How to contact us

If you have any questions about ORE’s privacy policy, the data we hold on you, or you would like to exercise one of your data protection rights, please do not hesitate to contact us.

The preferred method of initiating contact is to send a message to an administrator in-game or via Discord. If you cannot or do not want to do this, you may also send a message via email to privacy@openredstone.org.

For legal purposes with regards to GDPR response window restrictions, the date of reception of any data protection rights request will be considered to be that date where the request has been properly conveyed to the legal owner of the ORE server. If your means of contact is through a message to an administrator then they will make an honest attempt to assist in conveying your request to the appropriate party as quickly as possible. Requests sent to the email address may also see delay in reaching the appropriate party. Please be patient and understand that ORE is run and managed by volunteers. We will do our best to establish contact and notify you once your request has been properly conveyed.

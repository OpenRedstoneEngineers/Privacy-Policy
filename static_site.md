ORE makes a sincere effort to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction. We try our best to employ reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections.

## Privacy policies of other websites

The ORE websites may contain links to other websites. Our privacy policy applies only to our websites, so if you click on a link to another website, you should read their privacy policy.

## How to contact us

If you have any questions about ORE’s privacy policy, the data we hold on you, or you would like to exercise one of your data protection rights, please do not hesitate to contact us.

The preferred method of initiating contact is to send a message to an administrator in-game or via Discord. If you cannot or do not want to do this, you may also send a message via email to privacy@openredstone.org.

For legal purposes with regards to GDPR response window restrictions, the date of reception of any data protection rights request will be considered to be that date where the request has been properly conveyed to the legal owner of the ORE websites. If your means of contact is through a message to an administrator then they will make an honest attempt to assist in conveying your request to the appropriate party as quickly as possible. Requests sent to the email address may also see delay in reaching the appropriate party. Please be patient and understand that ORE is run and managed by volunteers. We will do our best to establish contact and notify you once your request has been properly conveyed.
